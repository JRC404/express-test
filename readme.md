# User Authentication Project

The aim for this project is to have a social profile for a user that the **user** can edit. 

It won't be incredibly fancy, it is to push myself to learn a combination of **Node, Express, Handlebars, MongoDB** and well, anything else that could be cool with it. 

### Reasoning behind the project

It is really easy to rest on what you already know and sit in a nice comfort zone, letting someone else look into issues when they arise and say **'oh, it's not my area.'**, I've done that with Node before and I don't like that; I am aiming to become somewhat good at the above stacks and hopefully, this project will assist in doing just that. 

### The style

I will be styling the site, but it isn't my priority. **For now**.

### Functionality
- [x] Create functionality checklist
- [ ] Populate checklist

### Templating

With handlebars, templating is key. 

#### Partials

The first partial has been created: Nav.hbs - this allows me to bring in the navbar into all pages by linking it with layout.hbs.

### Credits

**Dean Singleton** - Instrumental in the development of this project.
